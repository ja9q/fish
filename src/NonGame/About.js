        <h2>about this game</h2>
        <p className="line-spaced"> this is a React web app where you can go fishing by j9s. honestly, i've only gone fishing twice and i only caught a fish
          in one of those trips, so this game isn't rooted in facts and experience.</p>

        <p className="line-spaced"></p>
        <p className="line-spaced">this game was inspired by Amelia Blackwell's "the fishing game" on replit that i stumbled upon
            years ago. i was inspired to create my own fishing simulator when i learned that it's currently unplayable.
        </p>
        <p className="line-spaced">other influences include Orteil's CookieClicker and Frank Lantz's Universal Paperclips. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>game and visual assets (+ 2 sound effects) were done by j9s. all other sound effects were from Pixabay.</p>
