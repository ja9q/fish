        <p className="line-spaced"> this is a React web app where you can go fishing by j9s.</p>
        <p className="line-spaced"></p>
        <p className="line-spaced">this game was inspired by Amelia Blackwell's "the fishing game" on replit that i stumbled upon
            years ago. i was inspired to create my own fishing simulator when i learned that it's currently unplayable.

        <p className="line-spaced">other influences include Orteil's CookieClicker and Frank Lantz's Universal Paperclips. </p>
